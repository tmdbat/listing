hey everyone in this video i'm going to show you the handwriting and note taking performance of the m1 ipad pro 2021 and here i have is the 12.9 inch model the performance you can expect from the 11 inch model is going to be similar let me start by talking about the shadow effect at the edges so the shadow effect will be there regardless of the brightness of the display and this creates the illusion as if the lcd beneath is further away from the surface of the glass when you are writing there is no gap there is no parallax so the lines will still appear as if they are directly beneath the pen tip i just want to get that out first in case you're wondering if there's any gap between the lcd and the glass surface so this is still a laminated display you are getting with the ipad pro the handwriting apps that i'll be using in this video are apple notes wacom bamboo paper microsoft onenote Nebo and notes plus there are obviously many other handwriting and note taking apps i am not able to test them all so let's start with apple notes this is apple notes by default palm rejection has been turned on so if you want to write or draw with your finger it's not going to be possible you can only move the canvas apple notes is able to capture my handwriting rather accurately and this app supports pressure sensitivity with apple pencil tool you can actually double tap on the side here to get some shortcuts so the default shortcut is actually to switch between the brush or the pen and the eraser so now i'm using the eraser and now i'm using the pen again sometimes the double tab shortcut may get in the way of you writing because personally for me when i'm writing sometimes i may accidentally double tap and it starts erasing what i'm writing so that's obviously not good you can turn off the shortcut just do a search in the settings for apple pencil these are the shortcuts you can choose or you can just choose to turn off the shortcuts now whether or not the shortcuts will work will depend on the apps that you use because not all apps will support these shortcuts the apple pencil tip is hard plastic and it runs smoothly on this glass face it's not too slippery i do know there are people who prefer a more tactile writing experience so for those people who do you can apply a matte screen protector on the display however if you apply a match screen protector on the display it's going to affect the image quality and this is wacom bamboo paper apple pencil by default will provide palm rejection it's just basic palm rejection if you want perfect palm rejection like what you have seen earlier with apple notes you will have to turn on strict palm rejection and that feature may or may not be available depending on the app you use so for example with wacom bamboo paper i have no option to turn on streak palm rejection which means if i were to draw right with my finger you can see i can draw lines and this presents a problem when you are writing so when you're writing stop your palm is on the display it can introduce straight strokes welcome bamboo paper is able to capture my handwriting style rather accurately and this app supports pressure sensitivity this is microsoft onenote a very popular note-taking app this app is able to capture my handwriting rather accurately it supports pressure sensitivity and strict palm rejection right now i can use my finger to navigate the page if for some reason you want to use your finger to write or draw you have to switch off strict palm rejection and to do that just tap on this icon here and toggle this draw with touch so now when you use your finger you will be drawing or writing and if you want to navigate the page you can use double finger to move the pitch around but of course if you turn off straight palm rejection while we are writing with your palm resting on the display you will still have that chance of introducing straight strokes on the page if you have straight palm rejection turn off when you're writing and you have your palm on the display there is the risk of introducing straight strokes this app is enable enable has two notable features this app can convert your handwritten notes into editable text and this app also supports some gestures for example you can actually scrape a hole to delete some text but it doesn't work perfectly all the time this app is able to capture my handwriting accurately as well this app does not support pressure sensitivity enables handwriting recognition ai is quite accurate so even for this letter r which is not that obvious you can see here it managed to recognize that letter and for t h e here you can see it's not easy to read but the app was able to get that right and for fox fox the o and x here are almost combined together but again the app was able to read that accurately the last app i want to show you is notes plus this app is able to capture my handwriting rather accurately the thin and thick lines that you see are actually not the result of pressure sensitivity but the style that the app applies on top of your lines and it works pretty well this app also supports some gestures strict pump rejection with notes plus is different compared to the other apps that i showed you so here i can use my finger to navigate the pitch if i turn on straight palm rejection now my finger won't be able to do anything i can write but i cannot use my finger to navigate the page i can tap on the buttons here but that's about it to conclude i will give the handwriting and note taking performance of the ipad pro 2021 and a plus
